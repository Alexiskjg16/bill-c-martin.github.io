### Project Description
AVMA has three web applications with Healthplan Services:

- **Agent Portal** - AAgents sell policies, run quotes, and manage sales
- **Quoting Portal** - Individuals get quotes for numerous types of coverage
- **Member Portal** - Members view coverage, make payments, and get quotes  

### Contributions

My work with AVMA's portals in 2012 were driven largely by new feature requests:

- Integrate Google Analytics' conversion funnels for the quoting process
- Streamline the quoting process to increase usability
- Add new products for quoting, PDF proposal rendering, and premium rating

### Challenges Overcame

The biggest challenges I faced were with Google Analytics and AVMA's complex product offering:

- Implement Google Analystics and funneling for the first time
- Working with complex rating, plan, and benefit structures previously unexposed to

### Accomplishments

The AVMA portals were the first modular applications I've ever worked with. It uses components and modules that are shared across other web applications and rating platforms, such as:

- Quoting process
- Rating process
- Billing
- Case Listing

This opened my eyes for application development in terms of scalability and reusability, not to mention the far-reaching risks of making changes.
