###Project Description
AVMA has three web applications with Healthplan Services:

- **Agent Portal** - Agents run quotes, manage policy sales, and access benefit forms
- **Quoting Portal** - Individuals get quotes for insurance plans for themselves or family
- **Member Portal** - Members view benefits & coverage, make payments, and get quotes for policy changes and new coverage

###Contributions
The majority of my work with AVMA's portals occurred in 2012 when a series of features were requested. However, I continue maintaining their portals to this day. My contributions include:

- Integrating Google Analytics across the portals, including a conversion funnel for the quoting process
- Streamlining the quoting process to reduce the time it takes to run a quote
- Adding new products for quoting, which print to a PDF proposal after retrieving premium rates

###Challenges Overcame
This period marked a lot of growth for me as a junior web developer coming from a startup company, with my first experience in enterprise-level web applications. The biggest challenges I faced were mostly enterprise firsts:

- Working with billing systems for the first time, and all the concepts and terminology that comes with it
- Implementing Google Analystics and funneling for the first time
- Working with new rating, plan, and benefit systems previously unexposed to

###Accomplishments

The AVMA portals were the first modular applications I ever worked with. It uses component modules that are used on other sites and platforms, such as:

- Quoting process
- Rating process
- Billing
- Case Listing

This opened my eyes for application development in terms of scalability and reusability.
