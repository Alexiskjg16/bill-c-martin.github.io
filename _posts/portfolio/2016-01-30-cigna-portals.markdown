client: Cigna
application: Broker Portal, Enrollment Portal, Quoting Portal, & Bulk Premium Quote Tool
project-date: 2010 - 2012

description: <p>Cigna had five web applications with Healthplan Services&#58; </p><p><ul class="text-left"><li><b>Broker Portal</b> - sell individual and family plans by running quotes, submitting enrollments, and viewing commissions data, for appointed brokers</li><li><b>Quoting Portal</b> - quote individual and family health & dental plans for the public.</li><li><b>Enrollment Portal</b> - enroll in the health & dental plans quoted, for public & brokers.</li><li><b>Member Portal</b> - view benefits, make payments, and track reported claims, for members.</li></ul>

contributions: My work with Cigna's various portals spans three years, based largely on new feature requests, including adding support for quoting dental products across ten states, regularly adding and terminating health products across ten states for both quoting and enrollment, overhauling the billing details calculations and layout for members, adding dynamic sorting and pagination for brokers' case listing & management, and modifying PDF proposal mapping.

challenges-overcome: This period marked a lot of growth for me as a junior web developer coming from a startup company, with my first experience in enterprise-level web applications. The biggest challenges I faced were mostly enterprise firsts&#58; <ul><li>Learning an in-house MVC framework</li><li>Building and contributing to object-oriented classes</li><li>Implementing advanced DB2 features, such as cursors, to facilitate pagination in result sets</li><li>Integration into in-house case management software</li><li>Writing design and test documents</li><li>Working on teams consisting of business analysts, project managers, and quality assurance testers</li><li>Mapping values to PDFs proposals using complex XMLs</li><li>working with AJAX using Prototype</li><li>Learning the vast business domain of health and related insurance</li><li>Working on servers directly using tools such as vim, grep, and tail, through putty</li></ul>

Accomplishments: Other than surpassing the huge learning curve of domain knowledge and enterprise exposure as a junior developer, one of my biggest contributions of this time period was successfully supporting one of the biggest clients, as well as raising the bar on design and test document writing and standards. In addition to these, I also succeeded in writing an internally-used bulk premium rating tool that allows rate analysts to run large data sets of quotes through uploadable spreadsheet to test their own rating engines. This tool is still in use today, and continues to save countless hours for an entire team of rate analysts.
