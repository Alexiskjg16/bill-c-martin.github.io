title: I Love Being a Software Developer

Software development is logical and efficient, yet creative and artistic. That is basically the story of my life.

Even as a young lad, I was this mathy science boy that.. drew a lot. I'd go to school and just absolutely crush the life out of math. 

Then I would come home and draw these tedious, super-detailed drawings of comic book characters.

In later years, these base personality traits would manifest in the form of computers and music.

Computers were the perfect machines; they could just do anything. And they were a real hoot to take apart and put back together.

Music was the perfect artistic expression. It was something detailed and tedious I could try to master.

Moving forward in time, the two eventually merged in the form of coding. Here, we finally have something artistically creative, that is also coldly calculated.

I'm also an [INTJ](http://www.personalitypage.com/high-level.html), so I strongly suspect me and software development were destined for each other. I often wonder what would have become of me had I lived in the 1800s, though..

Anyways, fast-forward to now: Software development is great. It is so challenging, an endless puzzle to be solved, if one could just craft the solution.

It's also frontier and cutting edge, always evoling, especially compared to most careers. 

It also happens to pays well, of course.

One of the coolest things I think, though, is the fact that the only real tool required.. is a computer. In pretty much any other technical career I can think of, there is a massive amount of overhead involved: laboratories, equipment, expensive machines and software, etc.

Computers have replaced a lot of physical things. The [evolution of the desk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGI00HV7Cfw) has allowed me to construct my ultimate creations on a mere laptop, using concepts that I learned using a laptop, while listening to music that I created.. on a laptop.

I mean, it boggles my mind that I spend my working time thinking up solutions to problems, and then implementing them by hitting keys into a keyboard with my fingers.

Then, I play God when I go to run my code, breathing life into its lungs, with it's own little Big Bang at execution time, exploding into existence.

And I get paid to do this!

I highly recommend software development as a career choice. I always encourage my non-programmer friends to at least [try programming](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0) and see how they like it.
