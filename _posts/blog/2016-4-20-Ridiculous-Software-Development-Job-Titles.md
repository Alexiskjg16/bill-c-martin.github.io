Job Titles are what companies give to people to make them feel happy and important.

Sometimes, I even suspect job titles are what managers give to their employees to make the managers feel happy and important. 

"I manage a team of software engineers and architects" sounds a lot more important than "I manage a team of coders", doesn't it?

Well, I never intended to use this medium for complaining, but here goes!

### [Insert Non-Engineering Field] Engineer

* Audio Engineer
* Sales Engineer
* Project Engineer
* Studio Engineer
* Sanitation Engineer

What do all these job titles have in common? They are not actually engineers!

If one has not taken courses on mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences as well as studied principles & methods of analysis and design, they are not an engineer.

If one has not received an engineering degree from an accredited university or institute of some kind, they are not an engineer.

If one does not use a combination of mathematics, science, and ingenuity to solve problems that people have, they are not an engineer.

### Software Engineer

I still have mixed feelings on this title, which at least usually has a foundation in engineering education.

However, what most software engineers do day-to-day is not engineering.

A real engineer:

* is licensed or certified
* has public accountability
* uses mathematics & science, along with ingenuity, to solve problems

Software developers largely just use ingenuity and stackoverflow to solve their problems. There really is very little mathematics or science to it.

Real engineers use standard tools, metrics, and methods to produce systems with predictable outcomes that follow safety regulations.

Software developers use ever-changing tools, inconsistent metrics, and automated/manual testing to produce systems with ***unpredictable*** outcomes that do ***not*** follow any kind of safety regulations.

Real engineers plan robust, complete designs from the beginning and execute them to completion.

Software developers produce fragile, but flexible designs throughout the development process. And the product is never complete.

Compared to other forms of engineering which are well defined, tested, and regulated, software development is anything but those.

At the end of the day, software development has much more in common with craftsmanship, than it does with engineering. 

We build things with existing tool sets, not engineer them.

### Architect

This one suffers from exactly the same issues as "Software Engineer".

A real architect:

* makes decisions that affect public safety
* are licensed to practice architecture
* meets education, experience, and examination requirements

A software architect does none of these.

In my experience, a software architect is basically a senior software developer who no longer writes code, leaving them with just the strategic, high-level thinking & design focus.

However, a team with a quality mix of senior developers already have the business domain knowledge, and aptitude for strategic thinking and higher level architectural decision making.

Still, there can be value in having somebody in this type of role, particularly in large enterprise teams, so that there is somebody looking after performance, security, and scalability across the entire team.

They are just not architects, that's all I'm saying.

### Senior Developer

I know what you're thinking. How could I possibly have beef with this title?

Think about it. This title is usually either company-specific or tenure-based.

Regarding tenure, they say one must spend [10,000 hours](http://www.wisdomgroup.com/blog/10000-hours-of-practice/) coding in order to perfect their craft. 

Some "junior" developers hit this mark in only a few years. Other "senior" developers who have been at it for over a decade will never even hit this mark.

Such is the futility in determining qualification based on tenure.

Regarding company-specific definitions, these are probably the worst. 

Imagine [lazy, dumb, but successful](http://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-be-lazy-dumb-and-successful/) developers who have sat at the same company for years, doing the same unchallenging routine work.

That sort of setup allows them to ascend to "Senior Developer" because they have amassed company knowledge over the years and know domain and company-specific applications.

What's worse is when a brilliant 22-year-old gets hired as just a mere "web developer" and blows all the senior developers out of the water.

For all of these reasons, to me, a senior developer is somebody who can be left unattended, who leads others, and are looked up to by others for advice and guidance.

### Chief Field Engineer

I had to save the best for last.

To take someone who streams live bands with a camera on an in-house-developed website, which itself uses a 3rd party library & vendor, and calling them a "Chief Field Engineer" takes the cake.

If this seems like an odd ball job title from my past, it's because it is. If you think it was mine, it wasn't. I had some other ridiculous title I've long since forgotten about.

Ah.. startups.
