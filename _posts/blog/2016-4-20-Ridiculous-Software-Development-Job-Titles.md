title: Ridiculous Software Development Job Titles
category: blog

I never intended to use this medium for complaining, but here goes!

One thing that has irked me for years now about the profession of software development is its ridiculous job titles.

Job Titles are what a company gives to people to make them happy and feel important.

Without further ado.. the titles:

### Software Engineer

I still have mixed feelings on this one. However, I have mostly concluded that it's a ridiculous title, and possibly insulting to real engineers.

A real engineer:

* is licensed or certified
* has public accountability
* uses mathematics & science, along with their ingenuity, to solve problems

Software developers largely just use ingenuity and stackoverflow to solve their problems. There really is very little mathematics or science to it.

Real engineers use standard tools, metrics, and methods to produce systems with predictable outcomes.

We use buggy tools, arbitrary metrics, and manual testing. And what it produces is systems with unpredictable outcomes.

Real engineers plan robust, complete designs from the beginning and execute them to completion, whereas software/web development is almost never robust, complete, or even stable.

Compared to other forms of engineering which are well defined, tested, and regulated, software engineering lacks all of this stuff.

At the end of the day, software development has much more in common with craftsmanship, than it does with engineering. So do away with this ridiculous title.

### Architect

I won't even go into this one in great detail, as it suffers from exactly the same issues as "Software Engineer".

So let's talk about what they even do.

In my experience, a software architect is basically a senior software developer who no longer writes code, leaving them with just the strategic, high-level thinking & design focus.

Except, this position is only needed if the development team consists of juniors or perhaps low quality developers in general. How else could one justify such a position?

A team with a quality mix of senior developers already have the business domain knowledge, and aptitude for strategic thinking and higher level architectural decision making.

They've always just left a bad taste in my mouth. Like consultants.

### Senior Developer

I know what you're thinking. How could I possibly have beef with this title?

Think about it. This title is usually either company-specific or tenure-based.

Regarding tenure, they say one must spend [10,000 hours](http://www.wisdomgroup.com/blog/10000-hours-of-practice/) coding in order to perfect their craft. 

Some "junior" developers hit this mark in only a few years. Other "senior" developers who have been at it for over a decade will never even hit this mark.

Such is the futility in determining qualification based on tenure.

Regarding company-specific definitions, these are probably the worst. 

Imagine [lazy, dumb, but successful](http://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-be-lazy-dumb-and-successful/) developers who have sat at the same company for years, doing the same unchallenging routine work.

That sort of setup allows them to ascend to "Senior Developer" because they have amassed company knowledge over the years and know domain and company-specific applications.

What's worse is when a brilliant 22-year-old gets hired as just a mere "web developer" and blows all the senior developers out of the water.

For all of these reasons, to me, a senior developer is somebody who can be left unattended, who leads others, and are looked up to by others for advice and guidance.

### Chief Field Engineer

I had to save the best for last.

To take someone who streams live bands with a camera on an in-house-developed website, which itself uses a 3rd party library & vendor, and calling them a "Chief Field Engineer" takes the cake.

If this seems like an odd ball job title from my past, it's because it is. If you think it was mine, it wasn't. I had some other ridiculous title I've long forgotten about.

Ah.. startups.
