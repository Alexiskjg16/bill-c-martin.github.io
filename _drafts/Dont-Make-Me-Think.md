"Don't Make Me Think" is a classic book on web usability. This is what I learned from the book, reduced down to a two minute read. 

> Usability is how well a person of average ability and experience can figure out how to use a website to accomplish something without it being more trouble than it's worth.

### Don't Make Me Think

When a user looks at a web page, they should be able to get what it is, and how to use it, without expending any effort thinking about it. 

### Design for Scanning, not Reading 

People don't read web pages, they scan them. Wording should be concise, and wisely chosen. 

- Separate content into grid chunks
- Make clickable things ***look*** clickable
- Format text to support scanning: use headings, short paragraphs, lists

### Users Like Mindless Choices

> "It doesn't matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice."

### (Omit Needless Words)

"Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what's left." (3rd law)

Remove needless words.

- reduces noise level 
- makes useful content more prominent
- allows pages to be scanned better

Remove happy talk, aka small talk, introductory text, welcome text, etc. Instructions must die.

### Design Navigation Properly

Good navigation tells the user what is on the site, and how to use it. Always include a home link. Always include a search box to allow the user to bypass the navigation. Include breadcrumbs so the user knows where in the hierarchy they are, and make it obvious what page they are on in the navigation. Have prominent page names.

### The Home Page Should Spell out the Big Picture

The home page needs to answer these four questions as quickly and clearly as possible:

- What is this?
- What do they have here?
- What can I do here?
- Why should I be here and not somewhere else?

### Arguments About Usability Are a Waste of Time

CEOs, programmers, designers, and business people are all are biased to how they would like a page to look, based on their role in the company. Their opinions quickly turn into "religious debates". Debates on how the average user would use the site is pointless because the average user is not like us.

The only solution is usability testing.

### Keep Usability Testing Simple

A usability test is watching one person try to use something or doing typical tasks so you can detect and fix the things that confuse and frustrate them.

Sitting with a group at a table discussing the site (focus group testing) is not usability testing.

Testing one user is 100 percent better than testing none.

DIY testing can be done one morning per month, with three users.

A test session consists of:

- Welcome (4 min)
- Questions about user to put them at ease (2 min)
- Home page tour with user saying what they think it is (3 min)
- Tasks (35 min)
- Probing Questions (5 min)
- Wrapping Up (5 min)

Most common problems
- Users are unclear on the concept of the page or site
- The words they're looking for aren't there
- There's too much going on

Focus ruthless on fixing the most serious problems first.

### MOBILE??

Responsive design is hard to do well. 

- Allow zooming
- Keep every feature available that the full site has
- Or if not, make it easy to switch to the full site 

### Usability as a Common Courtesy?

The user's reservoir of goodwill lasts only so long before they leave. 

Don't do things to piss them off, and if you do piss them off, do these things:

- Make the main things that people want to do on your site obvious and easy
- Be up front about fees, outages etc.
- Make it easy to recover from errors
- Save the user steps whenever you can

### Accessibility

Test your site out with a screen reader to see how usable it is.

- Use headings correctly
- Add alt text to every image 
- Use labels on forms

### Sell Usability at Work

Screw ROI & sales language, instead, get your boss and stakeholders to watch a live usability test.
