title: How Each Jungian Cognitive Function Writes Code
category: blog

Summarize what MBti is, link to tests, link to function preference test, point out that mbti is dogmatic and isn't some end all be all measurement.

However, it does give a somewhat objective categorization system to leverage ones talents. Otherwise, most people go with instinct or abstract gut feelings about how people work and fit them together. I like to think in terms of MBTI because it brings it out from under one's nose and into plain eyesight.

## Research

### https://www.quora.com/Which-MBTI-type-is-the-best-in-coding

"But for the calling of a career involving decads of out of the job effort at staying current and doing it 8 long hours a day under constant pressure, introverted logical types are better suited, with different outcomes, INTP, INTJ, ISTJ and ISTP are all frequently found at programming shops and are the go to guys."

"Feelers(INFP, ESFJ, ISFJ) may become decent programmers or semi/hybrid-programmers or competent technician, but their human touch and disinterest for tech on its own will lead them in other roles, given the time."

"Similarly extroverted people will be bored to death if programming alone for years, they are the ones always busy at the phone gathering requirements and test cases looking for every opportunity to meet the users in person. Extroverts logical people(ENTJ,ENTP,ESTJ,ESTP) may become managers or entrepreneurs."

#### INTPs (and ENTPs)

"From experience, INTP. They're natural analyzers on a thought level. Ability to grasp technical and theoretical concepts with natural ease."

"ENTPs and INTPs tend to be the real, in-deep, elite, love it for the sake of it coders."

"Your classic, massively productive hacker is the ENTP - they love computers and produce good code very fast but only do what grabs their interest. ENTP types appear to have driven most innovation in home computing (hardware and software). Listen / read contemporary accounts from Hackers, heroes of the computer revolution."

"INTPs also love computers and can produce good code but they are extremely slow. They revel in the intricate detail of it and tend not to be focused on actually producing anything - being more interested in the process than the result"

#### $ INTJs

"Despite coding as a Ti (introverted thinking) dominant job, INTJ are also pretty good with writing software. They're good at risk management but lack the precision of the INTPs."

#### ENTJs

"I'm currently a technical manager who's an ENTJ but I started as a designer and developer. When writing software, I use intuition a lot more than thinking. This means my mind prioritizes the bigger picture of what is being done while using my thinking skills to write the code for it."

## Points

### How each function works for software development

- list
- of
- functions
- and one line definition

- and maybe also the same list of functions
- and how they are used for software development on the job


## Summary point

Yeah the Ti's might make the best "programmer" being perhaps the most important trait, but all functions contribute to any career, and this holds to true for software developers.  which is a well-rounded position not only focused on writing just code, but also dealing with your team, managers, clients, deadlines, processes, innovation () etc.

Teams

Leveraging individual function preferences (what most people would only see as "talents"). Stick the Ne on architecture/design, Te on execution, Ti on programming implementation, etc.

Close out with my INTJ personality, how I deal with things, etc.
