title: Lessons Learned from Reading 23 Books in 2016
category: blog
---

I'm biting [Julien Smith's idea](http://www.inoveryourhead.net/2012/02/22/lessons-i-learned-reading-over-200-books/) with this post, but I really would love to start reflecting on what I read every year, since reading is such a major part of my life.

List book names, cover art, and a  1-3 sentence blurb underneath.
