title: The Evolution of Me as a Developer
category: blog
---

This is the story of how I got into software development. The high level synopsis is:

1. **The Spark**: It all started with some HTML, CSS, Java, SQL classes I took in high school.
2. **The Kindling**: I wrote a Paypal module for my gaming clan's site in PHP.
3. **The Flame**: My first web development job in 2006.
4. **The Fire**: My first professional/enterprise job at a large company in 2010.
5. **The Inferno**: I step into a senior/lead role in 2016 and start focusing on independence, people, and process efficiency.

## 1. The Spark

It all started with some HTML, CSS, Java, SQL classes I took in high school, with a very inspirational teacher. I suppose this was preceded though by a childhood interest in math and science though, and a desire to become an engineer one day.

The first site I make is a site about Beavis and Butthead. A passion is born. No, not Beavis and Butthead.. for web development!

### 1999 Me:

- **Day 0**: Mom gets me to take some web design classes, "computers are the next big thing"
- **Day 30**: Wow this HTML thing is so logical, yet creative.

### 2007 Me:

- **Day 90:** These guys are actually looking up to me and asking for advice. weird...
- **Day 120**:
        * We take on the impossible, building 4 massive applications in 1 year
        * And all new extremely bold architecture
        * I inherit the complicated SAML/SSO piece.
- **Day 180:** These juniors are really talented, what a Renaissance this is!

- **Day 270:** Somehow, someway, successfully converted all the highest traffic sites with little issue. Hurray!
- **Day 365:** The official "PHP7 Guy". The PHP7 saga continues, forever and ever.

### 2018 Me:
