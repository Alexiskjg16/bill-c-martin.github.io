logical, efficient

creative, art

appeal to INTJ/INTP Myers Briggs, strongly suspect me and software development were destined for each other.

Constant state of learning new things

Exciting. I work on health insurance websites, and it still manages to be exciting

Frontier & cutting edge, compared to most job titles
