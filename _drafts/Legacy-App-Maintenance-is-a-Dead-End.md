title: Legacy App Maintenance Is A Dead End
category: blog
---

All programmers should post a sign at the precipice of their old code: "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here"

There's so many reasons to want to avoid legacy app maintenance; the Bane of the Pragmatic Programmer; the Path to Code Janitor, the Nine Circles of Hell.

(run with the Nine Circles of Hell/Inferno concept):

(Add something about no Virgil to guide you [ no devs around anymore] Good luck, friend!)

##Stunted Development Skills
   
Legacy code reprograms ones precious neuron connections to support bad habits, especially to a budding developer dropped into an enterprise environment that doesn't know any better.

It is where the wicked gather:

* God Classes
* Poltergeist Classes
* LongFunctionNamesThatDescribeAllTheStuffThatTheyDo()
* WET code
* Flag-infested method parameters 
* Rigid coupling
* Broken Windows of all kinds

It's like doing your fellow developers' dirty laundry of yesteryear, some of whom are long gone. You get to see all of their stains and skid marks in their full glory.

Spending your days patching and maintaining 5 to 10 year old cold (or older in the case of )

   Outdates developers
   Working on 5 - 10 year old code
   especially with a language like PHP, who lived in the wild-wild west ten years ago.

##The Code Janitor
Traps You in an endless cycle of fixing things others break

Dead end path

Lacks creativity
Mind numbing

##Company Coupling
value is measured in how well you know the business domain of the apps
Little recognition and visibility, or the wrong kind of recognition and visibility.
Become known as the guy that xxx.

##Somebody Has To Do It

Not inherently a bad thing. 
Want safe careers at a single company

Counter arguments:

legacy code has use, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

learn from other's mistakes: how NOT to design an application, if you're self-aware

see how far your fellow developers have come

I'm no Master Programmer, I have a lot to learn, which is part of the reason I'm converting my thoughts into ASCII characters by wiggling my fingers really fast into a keyboard right now. 

my old code, from even a year ago, makes me cringe. To future developers that have to read it: I profusely apologize :)
