Ah, books. This is my love letter to fantasy/sci-fi, with its life lessons, philosophical ponderings, and insight into the human condition.

Fantasy ignites creativity and imagination.

> A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. The man who never reads lives only one.
>
> <span>― George R.R. Martin</span>

> Books say: She did this because. Life says: She did this. Books are where things are explained to you; life is where things aren’t. I’m not surprised some people prefer books.
> <span>― Julian Barnes</span>

> Think before you speak. Read before you think.” 
> <span>― Fran Lebowitz</span>

> We don’t need a list of rights and wrongs, tables of dos and don’ts: we need books, time, and silence. Thou shalt not is soon forgotten, but Once upon a time lasts forever.
> <span>― Philip Pullman</span>


I'm a firm believer that there are life lessons to be learned in sci fi and fantasy.


> Many people, myself among them, feel better at the mere sight of a book.” 
> <span>― Jane Smiley</span>

> Books help us understand who we are and how we are to behave. They show us what community and friendship mean; they show us how to live and die.
> <span>― Anne Lamott</span>

> Fantasy is hardly an escape from reality. It's a way of understanding it.
> <span>― Lloyd Alexander</span>

> Fiction is the lie through which we tell the truth.” 
> <span>― Albert Camus</span>

> Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.
> <span>― Michael Scott</span>
